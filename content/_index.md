CellSV is more than an XML to CSV converter, it allows you to read an XML file in excel by simplifying the file while preserving the original structure of the content, for you to view and edit as a spreadsheet.

+ Here you can convert an [XML file to CellSV](/xml2csv)
+ Here you can convert back a [CellSV or CSV file to XML](/csv2xml)

### How to use

Just drag and drop your files or add them though the menu, once you have selected all the files that you want to convert hit __Convert__, the converted files will download automatically as they are ready.

### Why

Most XML to CSV online converters expect tabulated data, that means they work better when you have a file with similar data entries, but...
#### __What happens if my file has a great variety of data entries?__
then the resulting file will be huge, probably will be a couple of rows with thousands of columns since every value is unique, so it will be hardly usable.   
#### __That's not what I want!__
Try with CellSV, it preserves the original file structure to create a human readable file that can be easily manipulated as a spreadsheet, and when you are done you can turn the CellSV back to XML [right here](/csv2xml).

### How it works

CellSV works right on your browser, so your files are safe, they won't be uploaded to an unknown server, and will be converted nearly instantaneously since the process takes place in your computer, just add the files to the _drop-zone_ and hit _Convert_, the resulting files will be downloaded automatically has they are ready.

### Notes

Currently there is an arbitrary limit to the files size of 20MB and a limit in the number of files that can be converted in one go of 25.
